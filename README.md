We want to give users the option to run a light weight server local to where their ZIO app is running that supports a few commands to aid monitoring and metrics of their application.

### Commands

Commands to support:

- Fiber Dump - Fiber dump of all fibers
- Metrics
    - stdout - prints metrics to stdout
    - prometheus - pushes metrics to prometheus
    - prometheus & other metrics integrations supported by utilizing `zio-metrics`
- Test 
    - Server replies with a test message - used to test server working

### Client

Clients send commands to the server and wait for a response. Initially we are planning to support a CLI tool as the client but do plan to support some level of IDE/Text editor support to aid debugging.

### Protocol

The protocol used to communicate between the client and server is a cut down version of the RESP protocol that Redis uses. For more information on this protocol please see the specification docs: [Redis Protocol specification – Redis](https://redis.io/topics/protocol)

Choosing this protocol enables us to have something simple to implement without any external dependencies being introduced and thereby keeping the client and server lightweight. 

## Post MVP ideas for roadmap

- Ability to send fiber dump and metrics to:
    - Kafka
    - Redis
    - Elasticsearch
- Support the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) for IDE/Text editor support

## Design questions and decisions to review

- How are we going to enable the user to choose which port the server uses? 
- Any security considerations? 
- Use `zio-metrics` as a dependency or merge the two projects into this repo.
