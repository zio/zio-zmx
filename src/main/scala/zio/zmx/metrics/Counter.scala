/**
 * A `Counter` is a metric representing a single numerical value that may be
 * incremented over time. A typical use of this metric would be to track the
 * number of a certain type of request received. With a counter the quantity
 * of interest is the cumulative value over time, as opposed to a gauge where
 * the quantity of interest is the value as of a specific point in time.
