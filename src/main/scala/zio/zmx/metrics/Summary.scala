 * A `Summary` represents a sliding window of a time series along with metrics

 * interest. For example, if we were using a summary to track the response time
 * for requests over the last hour then we might be interested in the 50th
 * percentile, 90th percentile, 95th percentile, and 99th percentile for
 * response times.
